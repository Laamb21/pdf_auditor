## 1. Project Overview
## Project Name: PDF Auditor
## Prepared By: Liam Slade
## Date: 07-30-2025

## 1.1 Purpose 
The PDF Auditor exists to give accessibility teams and website owners an easy-to-use desktop tool that automates end-to-end compliance checks on PDFs published on any public website. It combines web scraping, PDF retreival, and standard-based accessibility analysis all into a single GUI.

## 1.2 Background 
During my time at archSCAN LLC, I took lead on promoting and demonstrating one of our new services: Accessibility-on-Demand (AoD). This on-demand service provided a much more cost effective and time efficient way to remediate documents by utilizing artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. One of the ways I went about promoting and demonstrating this service was when we had a lead/potential client, I would grab any public facing documentation from their organization's website and check for compliance (any documentation that I would find to be non-compliant would then be used in demonstrating AoD). When doing so, I found that manually going through a website and downloading every PDF I found was very time-consuming and inefficient.  

## 2. Objectives 
This solution serves to:<br> 
    1. Discover all publicly-linked PDF documents on a target site via webscraping. 
    2. Retrieve and download those PDFs to a specified directory 
    3. Analyze each PDF for key accessibility criteria (PDF/UA and WCAG 2.1) 
    4. Report results into an Excel workbook that which documents passed and failed

All within a time-efficient manner and presented in a user-friendly GUI
